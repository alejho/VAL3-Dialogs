<h1>VAL3-DialogsSignals</h1>

<p>
User pages creation in SP1 (the teach pendent of the CS8C robots controller) is quite boring and difficult.<br>
This library make it easy for a few "standard" page templates ("yes-no" questions, multiple choice, editing of cartesian coordinates and more).<br>   
  
The library is written for version 7 of the language.
<br>
In this repo you'll find a folder with the actual library (libDialogs) to be installed on the controller and another folder with a full documentation in italian (docs).
